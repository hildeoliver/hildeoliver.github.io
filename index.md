Hi! I'm Hilde Oliver. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/holiver/).

I study how the changing physical environment influences marine biogeochemical cycling. During my PhD at the University of Georgia, I studied the impacts of glacial melting on subarctic and Antarctic coastal primary productivity and nutrient cycling.
