Understanding the warming climate's impact on marine ecosystems requires coupling complex ocean fluid dynamics to the highly nonlinear chemical, physiological, and ecological processes governing the growth of marine biota. Hilde Oliver studies how such shifts in the physical environment influence bottom-up controls on marine primary productivity using coupled physical-biogeochemical numerical models in combination with data collected in-situ and via satellite remote sensing.  Her specific interests lie at the intersection of physical, chemical, and biological oceanography in contrasting hotspots of rapid change, including coastal Greenland, the Southern Ocean, and the U.S. northeast continental shelf and slope.

Oliver received her B.S. (2014) in mathematics from the University of South Carolina in 2014 and her Ph.D. (2019) in marine sciences at the University of Georgia, where she was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to study how glacial meltwater influences coastal marine ecosystems using Regional Ocean Modeling Systems (ROMS). She arrived at WHOI as a Postdoctoral Scholar in 2019, where she used combined observational and modeling approaches to study bio-physical interactions at the New England shelf break. She joined the WHOI Department of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering as an Assistant Scientist in November 2021.
