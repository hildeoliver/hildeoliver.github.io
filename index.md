I am an interdisciplinary oceanographer broadly interested in the ways climate-sensitive physical features influence marine biogeochemical cycling, especially in the coastal ocean.

I am currently investigating how Gulf Stream meanders impact primary productivity in the Mid-Atlantic Bight as a Postdoctoral Scholar at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/holiver/), under the supervision of Dennis McGillicuddy and Weifeng Gordon Zhang.

For my PhD work at the University of Georgia, I studied the impacts of glacial melting on high latitude coastal primary productivity and nutrient cycling, with focus on Greenland Ice Sheet melt to the Labrador Sea and West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt to the Amundsen Sea Polynya.
