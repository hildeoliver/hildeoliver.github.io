Hi! I'm Hilde Oliver. I study how the changing environment influences marine biogeochemical cycling.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/holiver/), where I am researching how frontal dynamics govern phytoplankton growth in the New England shelfbreak region. During my PhD at the University of Georgia, I studied how glacial meltwater affects subarctic and Antarctic coastal primary productivity.
