I am an interdisciplinary oceanographer broadly interested in the ways climate-sensitive physical features influence marine biogeochemical cycling, especially in the coastal ocean.

I am currently investigating how Gulf Stream meanders impact primary productivity in the Mid-Atlantic Bight as a Postdoctoral Scholar at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/holiver/), working with Dennis McGillicuddy and Weifeng Gordon Zhang. My PhD at the University of Georgia focused on the impacts of glacial melting on subarctic and Antarctic coastal primary productivity and nutrient cycling.
