I am an interdisciplinary oceanographer interested in how climate-sensitive physical features influence marine biogeochemical cycling, especially in dynamic coastal and frontal regions. I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/holiver/), where I am investigating how changing circulation influences primary productivity near the New England shelfbreak. For my PhD, I focused on how glacial meltwater from the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets impacts coastal primary productivity. In my free time, I enjoy reading, skating, and exploring Cape Cod with my chiweenie mix, Stanley. 

**Update: In fall 2021, I will be starting as an Assitant Scientist at WHOI!**
