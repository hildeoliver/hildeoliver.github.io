I am an oceanographer working to understand the biogeochemical consequences of coastal ocean dynamics. I am broadly interested in how climate-sensitive physical oceanographic features influence marine biogeochemical cycling. Using coupled physical-biological numerical models, my research aims to 1) identify the mechanisms that drive observed biogeochemical signals, and 2) constrain the  impact of climate-sensitive dynamics on marine ecosystems.

I am currently investigating how submesoscale features caused by Gulf Stream meanders drive phytoplankton blooms in the Mid-Atlantic Bight as a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering (AOPE) at [WHOI](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/holiver/), under the supervision of Dennis McGillicuddy and Gordon Zhang.

For my PhD work, I studied the impacts of glacial melting on high latitude coastal primary productivity and nutrient cycling using Regional Ocean Modeling Systems [(ROMS)](https://www.myroms.org), with focus on Greenland Ice Sheet melt to the Labrador Sea and West Antarctic Ice Sheet melt to the Amundsen Sea Polynya.
