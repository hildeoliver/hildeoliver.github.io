**June 2021**
- New paper in GRL- ["Diatom hotspots driven by western boundary current instability"](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091943). In this paper, we present findings of high-chlorophyll, subsurface diatom hotspots driven by intrusions of high-nutrient Gulf Stream water in the MAB slope sea. This research was [spotlighted in Eos](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/gulf-stream-intrusions-feed-diatom-hot-spots), and featured in a [WHOI press release](https://www.whoi.edu/press-room/news-release/papers-explore-massive-plankton-blooms-with-very-different-ecosystem-impacts/) on phytoplankton blooms found during SPIROPA expeditions to the New England shelf break.

**April 2021**
- On April 14, I gave a seminar to the WHOI AOPE department about subsurface diatom hotspots in the Middle-Atlantic Bight Slope Sea in July 2019 (SPRIOPA cruise TN368).

**March 2021**
- After 78 days away (60 days at sea) and nearly 13,000 nautical miles, I am back in Woods Hole! A huge thanks to everyone on the SAMW team for a fantastic cruise.
- For International Women's Day, OOI [highlighted](https://oceanobservatories.org/2021/02/hilde-oliver-carrying-on-the-tradition-of-smart-educated-women/) me on their site. 

**December 2020**
- From December 26 till February 23, I will be aboard the R/V Roger Revelle on a cruise to the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean to investigate the biological and chemical conditioning of Sub-Antarctic Mode Water. [Follow along with the cruise blog here](https://blog.bigelow.org/tag/samw21/). I will have limited email access during this period.

  <figcaption>Schematic of fjord-scale modeling done in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016185">Oliver et al., 2020</a>. Cold, fresh meltwater discharged at the base of the marine-terminating glacier is introduced at the depth of neutral buoyancy, calculated by the half-conical plume model. The colder, fresher glacially modified water (blue arrows) exits the fjord above the warmer and saltier Atlantic Water (red arrow) intruding into the fjord and toward the glacier face.</figcaption>

**June 2020**
- New paper out in [JGR](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016185). For this work we combined buoyant plume theory with a biogeochemical model in an idealized fjord-scale ROMS model to assess potential important factors on nutrient export beyond the fjord, and found that subglacial discharge rate, grounding depth, and controls on nutrient residence time could all exert a large influence on transport. [Check out ICEPLUME for ROMS here.](https://github.com/ChuningWang/roms-iceplume)

**February 2020**
- On Feb. 12 I gave a seminar on my Greenland modeling work to the AOPE Department at WHOI, and on Feb. 21 I presented the fjord-scale work at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego.

**October 2019**
- I have started as a Postdoctoral Scholar at Woods Hole Oceanographic, working under the supervision of [Dennis McGillicuddy](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/dmcgillicuddy/) and [Gordon Zhang](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/wzhang/). I will be doing physical-biogeochemical modeling in the mid-Atlantic bight during my time here.

**August 2019**
- The final draft of my dissertation has been submitted, and all of my degree requirements are done! Thanks to everyone who supported me through this journey. I have now left Athens, and will be taking the next few months off to finish up some manuscripts before starting at WHOI as a Postdoctoral Scholar in October.

**July 2019**
- I went back to sea in the mid-Atlantic bight with the [SPIROPA](http://science.whoi.edu/users/olga/SPIROPA/SPIROPA.html) team for another two weeks, but this time on the Thomas G. Thompson (TN368). Thanks to everyone on board for another great cruise!

**June 2019**
- I successfully defended my dissertation on June 10. Thank you to my advisors, my committee, and my friends and family for all of their support through these PhD years.

**May 2019**
- I went to sea (for the first time in nearly five years)! I spent two weeks in the mid-Atlantic bight with the [Shelfbreak Productivity Interdisciplinary Research Operation at the Pioneer Array (SPIROPA)](http://science.whoi.edu/users/olga/SPIROPA/SPIROPA.html) team on the Ron Brown (RB1904), with Dennis McGillicuddy as chief scientist. Special thanks to fellow CTD watch leaders Gordon Zhang and Marshall Swartz for all their hard work and patience training me. Looking forward to heading back in July!
- My new first-author paper in GBC is now typeset and ready for consumption. For this study we used a 1-D model to evaluate the importance of light vs. iron as controlling factors on the extremely productive Antarctic polynya in the Amundsen Sea. [GBC PDF here.](https://hildeoliver.github.io/papers/Oliver_et_al-2019-Global_Biogeochemical_Cycles.pdf) This study is complementary to our 3D modeling study published earlier this year in JGR, led by Pierre St-Laurent.
